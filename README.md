Here you can find all I've done on LTspice and maybe later I'll put here verilog code as well

In the directory 'workcatalog' is my task for the first lab work: to make NAND from transistors and then produce full comparator for 4-bit numbers based only on NANDs

In the directory 'useful tools' you can find NAND, NOR and NOT made of transistors, boolean basis made of the first 3 as well. Later I'll put there anything I find useful.
